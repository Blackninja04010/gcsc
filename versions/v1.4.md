# V1.4

Changelog
- better performance
- made the source code more compact
  
*upcoming* 

- automated/console messages will now have **GCSC** before them to be able to more easily tell that they’re automated
- more bosses, better boss fights, and rarities for the bosses
- Fishing will be a feature that is in the works now! I estimate 5 days to 2 weeks until it’s released!
